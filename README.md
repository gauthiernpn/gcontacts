# Google Shared Contacts


On most Google Apps domains, the only shared contact details between users are the users themselves; ie. you can always
find your colleagues in your phone's or email application's autocomplete feature.

A less known feature is called "shared contacts". Any arbitrary contact can be added to the "shared contacts"
so everybody within the domain can see these people's details. This can be extremely useful, since it allows you to
share client's information, external company details and other people many of your colleagues might come in contact
 with.
